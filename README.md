# Weekend Project - React Gallery

## Description

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).

### Overview:

The core function of this weekend project was to display various images to the screen and allow users to interact with those photos.


### Features:

Each photo is displayed as its own card. Slight CSS transitions help indicate which card the user is currently hovered or focused on.

Each card shows the *total* number of likes that photo has received through button-clicks.

On each click of the __love it!__ button, that count is incremented by a count of one.

Finally, when the user clicks on the image itself, a description of the photo will display over that current photo.
    ***NOTE:*** I understand the assignment asked the swap between the photo and the description, but after seeing the appearance of that feature I modified it to show as it currently appears on the site. This function could be swapped back to the intended functionality upon request.
